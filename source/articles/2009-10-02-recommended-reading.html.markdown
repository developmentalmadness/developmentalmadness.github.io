This post is as much for myself and for anyone. There are times when the flood of information is overwhelming. I have recently been interested in many new technologies I have noticed. Sometimes a technology can be available, but unless I hear about it and see how it applies it just gets lost in the noise. For example, MapReduce is something I keep seeing around a lot lately, but I am only just starting to “get it” and am trying to read tidbits about it here and there.

But two articles which really struck me this week were on the Rx Framework and Functional Programming. The first because I have been doing a lot of asynchronous programming lately with Silverlight. The second because I have been hearing about F# for a long time now, but really haven’t seen an immediate need for it. Sometimes, just I really need a specific  application for a technology before I can really dig in and understand it. This second article isn’t specifically about F#, but rather functional programming in general, and is really something that spoke to me and I could really see how it could be used day-to-day.

Anyhoo, enough of my blabbering. Here are the links and hopefully, when I get the time to dig into these I’ll have the time to pass on what I learn to you as well:
