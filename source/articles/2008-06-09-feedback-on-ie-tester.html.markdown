I ran into a link for [IETester](http://www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/IETester/HomePage) today. Supposedly, you can use it to test a site in different IE versions. But it's in alpha, I'm curious if anyone has had experience with the company or has been doing any significant evaluation of IETester up to this point. I'd like to keep an eye on it and see how it progresses at this point. Up to this point I've been using MultipleIE, but only because it's the only tool I know of. It doesn't work great for UpdatePanel and the client I'm working for right now uses this control alot.
