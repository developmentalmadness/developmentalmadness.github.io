I have been working on a "load balancing" application for OLAP applications and one or two of my previous posts touch on some things I've learned in the process. But now that I've got a working beta version I've decided to write my first "formal" article based on what I've learned. I've posted the article on my favorite developer community site, codeproject.com. Here's the link:

The article is written based on using an ASP.Net application as the client for the load balancer, but in reality the client could be windows based as well.
