As all good developers, my first words are the well-known greeting which states, "Hey it works!". I have no idea who will be interested in my comments, but I wanted a place were I could share my discoveries with whoever was interested.

I have found so much helpful information on the web which has enabled me to do what I love and do it well. I have wanted to return the favor for sometime, but I just don't have to time to sit down and write a well-structured coherant article. But when I learn something, I want to put it out there for anyone who's having the same problem. Hopefully they'll find the answer in what I will write.

If they don't, I recommend www.codeproject.com, my favorite source code site and community of developers.
