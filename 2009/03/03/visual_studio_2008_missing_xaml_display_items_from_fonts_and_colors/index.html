<section class='post-content'><p>The members of my team and I have been playing around with our fonts and colors settings over the last few weeks. We’ve downloaded a couple published settings files from some well known bloggers such as Conery and Hanselman and tweaked them a little.</p>

<p>I was sent a copy of some settings from Rob Conery and the XAML settings were unreadable. I don’t know where the settings originated or how old they were but the background was black and the foreground colors where bright red and blue. I couldn’t read them. Other than that I really like the color scheme.</p>

<p>So I decided to go in and modify the color settings for XAML. But they were missing completely from my “Display Items” list. (Tools – Options… – Environment – Fonts and Colors – Display Items). I ran a search and a couple posts mentioned running &ldquo;devenv /setup” from the command line. But when I did I got the following error from Visual Studio:</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">The operation could not be completed. The requested operation requires elevation.</font></strong></p>

<p>I am running Vista x32 with a non-admin account. Usually I just get a prompt for administrator credentials, but not this time. So I decided to try runas from the command line:</p>

<p>runas /user:administrator “devenv /setup”</p>

<p>This worked – for the admin account. I opened an instance of Visual Studio and was still missing the XAML display items, but if I opened Visual Studio as administrator they XAML items were all there.</p>

<p>So then I tried adding myself to the Administrators group in Windows. I figured, I’d temporarily elevate my privileges, run the command and then revert my access rights back to normal. Well, this didn’t work either, I still got the same error message.</p>

<p>So finally after digging around a while longer, I found an off-topic post when mentioned running</p>

<p>devenv /resetskippkgs</p>

<p>I had done this before for something else and hadn’t had a problem. So I decided to try it. This worked. It didn’t require admin privileges and I got my XAML settings back. Afterwards, I just mirrored the XML settings to the XAML settings and I’m now enjoying Rob’s theme.</p>
