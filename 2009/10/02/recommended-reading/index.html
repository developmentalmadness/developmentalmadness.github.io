<section class='post-content'><p>This post is as much for myself and for anyone. There are times when the flood of information is overwhelming. I have recently been interested in many new technologies I have noticed. Sometimes a technology can be available, but unless I hear about it and see how it applies it just gets lost in the noise. For example, MapReduce is something I keep seeing around a lot lately, but I am only just starting to “get it” and am trying to read tidbits about it here and there.</p>

<p>But two articles which really struck me this week were on the Rx Framework and Functional Programming. The first because I have been doing a lot of asynchronous programming lately with Silverlight. The second because I have been hearing about F# for a long time now, but really haven’t seen an immediate need for it. Sometimes, just I really need a specific  application for a technology before I can really dig in and understand it. This second article isn’t specifically about F#, but rather functional programming in general, and is really something that spoke to me and I could really see how it could be used day-to-day.</p>

<p>Anyhoo, enough of my blabbering. Here are the links and hopefully, when I get the time to dig into these I’ll have the time to pass on what I learn to you as well:</p>
