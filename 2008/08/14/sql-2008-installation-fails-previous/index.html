<section class='post-content'><p>I have been trying since yesterday to install the RTM of SQL 2008. But once I have selected the components to install I get a failure during the check of installation rules. The rule failing is &ldquo;Previous releases of Microsoft Visual Studio 2008&rdquo;. I have downloaded and installed Visual Studio 2008 SP 1. In fact I&rsquo;ve run the install several times.</p>

<p>Then I found this post describing why this error is happening. It turns out I had installed and uninstalled an RC version of 2008 several months ago. But I still had <strong>Visual Studio 2008 Shell (integrated mode)</strong> installed as well. So I uninstalled this. But after completing the uninstall I was still unable to install SQL 2008.</p>

<p>So I went back to the SP 1 page and noticed there was a separate link for Express Editions of Visual Studio. I remembered I had VC++ 2008 Express installed! After visiting I found this little gem in the page :</p>

<h3>IMPORTANT</h3>

<p>If you have multiple Visual Studio products installed, you must upgrade all of them to SP1. <strong>If you have Visual Studio 2008 and one or more 2008 Express Editions, you cannot upgrade the Express Editions until you have upgraded Visual Studio.</strong></p>

<p>That is the kicker. I had to install SP 1 for VS 2008 first, then ALSO install SP1 for VC++ 2008. This goes for all express editions: Web Developer Express, Visual Basic Express and Visual C# as well as VC++ Express.</p>

<p>I am in the process of installing VC++ 2008 SP 1 (which appears to be a full install), if I run into any other problems I&rsquo;ll update this post. But otherwise, this should correct the issue. Hope it helps!</p>
