<section class='post-content'><p>Today <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2010/09/28/createsequetialuuid-ndash-answer.aspx" rel="nofollow">Ayende</a> released his sequential guid answer, which is something I had been working on as well. I’ll be honest and say the current implementation takes from his recent posts (previous to today’s). If it weren’t for him, I would not have known about the Sql Server sorting idiosyncrasies – at least not until much later when we were experiencing serious index fragmentation.</p>

<p>You can see my implementation below. Realize that this implementation was written only with Sql Server in mind, so I don’t use any other byte order than will work with Sql Server as his does. Also, I am not using any kind of incrementing counter as it is not worth the effort in my case. Ayende’s context is that of a single system – he isn’t looking for something that would be sequential globally. His guids will always be sequential, even under high load (more than 1,000/second). However, they are not guaranteed to be sequential across system boundries. Neither is mine, but since my implementation will is not intended to guarantee sequentialness (yeah I made word up) for guids generated for the same value of DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks there is no reason (at the moment) for me to add the overhead.</p>

<p>I made the choice because my Comb type is meant to be used at the client and sent to the server for eventually consistent scenarios. And currently the load on our servers doesn’t justify the effort of trying to guarantee a sequence across systems. I thought about using something like the MAC address as suggested by Ayende, but that still doesn’t guarantee that guids generated on different system will be sequential, just grouped. So for the time I am willing to allow a small amount of fragmentation (20% by <a href="http://developmenttips.blogspot.com/2008/03/generate-sequential-guids-for-sql.html" rel="nofollow">my own tests</a>) in high-throughput scenarios because those will be rare for the system I am developing.  </p>

<p>Also, because my Comb type is meant to be used by the client and passed to the service, I wanted to be able to verify that the value sent by the client was actually generated by Comb, I set the first “nibble” (half of the byte) of the 6th byte to 1100. This borrows from the method used by Microsoft, as mentioned in Jimmy Nilsson’s original article, of setting the first nibble of the 7th byte (the one I am copying to the 6th byte) to 0100. This could end in false positives if someone were to use some other method besides Guid.NewGuid() to gernate their guids, but since it won’t happen in the system this was developed for I don’t need the overhead of additional checks, yet.</p>

<h2><font color="#ff0000"><strong>Update 6/15/2011</strong></font></h2>

<p>While researching some details for providing a Java implementation of my Comb class, I read on Wikipedia that the bytes I am referring to in the previous paragraph are actually standard bytes used by all Guid/Uuid implementations to set the version. This indicates which version was used to generate the value. So on one hand, I am using these bits as they were intended. However, on the other hand there is the possibility of running into version number conflicts down the road if there is a version which clashes with mine which will result in false positives. At the moment the highest version number is 5, 0100 refers to version 4 and my version is declared as 12. So I‘m safe for at least 7 more versions :).</p>

<p>I am curious however to hear from Ayende about why his is reversing his byte arrays. Let me know what you think of my version vs his. (I consider him to be beyond me in skill so I’m not asking for whose is better, I just would like some feedback in comparison).</p>
