<section class='post-content'><p>Just saw an <a href="http://sdtimes.com/eclipse-che-beta-arrives/" rel="nofollow">announcement</a> for <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/che/" rel="nofollow">Eclipse CHE</a> beta last night. Currently I&rsquo;m more of an <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" rel="nofollow">IntelliJ</a> fan and I was even excited to hear about the development of an IntelliJ-based IDE for .NET (<a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2016/01/13/project-rider-a-csharp-ide/" rel="nofollow">Project Rider</a>). </p>

<h1>Setting Up CHE</h1>

<p>For those just interested in getting started with CHE here&rsquo;s how (you may want to also review the <a href="https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/usage#command-line" rel="nofollow">command-line startup docs</a> for troubleshooting or special conditions I don&rsquo;t cover here):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/che/download/" rel="nofollow">Download</a> Eclipse CHE ZIP or TGZ package. (There&rsquo;s installers for Windows &amp; OSX, but I prefer a low-impact setup).</p>

<p>CHE is a server. So if your team is using it you&rsquo;ll do this on a central server instead of on a developer&rsquo;s machine. We&rsquo;re also going to go full Docker here instead of installing a local server on your machine - again low-impact.</p>

<p>Extract the archive wherever you want it installed. For OSX/Linux:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>tar -xvf eclipse-che-latest.tar.gz
</code></pre>
<h1>The Easy Way</h1>

<p>If you prefer the easiest way, I was contacted by <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerJewell" rel="nofollow">@TylerJewell</a> CHE Team Lead to let me know I&rsquo;ve been trying to hard. If you don&rsquo;t care if the CHE server is running in Docker then simply do the following at this point:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ cd eclipse-che-[version]
$ bin/che.sh run
</code></pre>
<p>Or on windows</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ bin\che.bat run
</code></pre>
<p>Now just navigate to http://localhost:8080 and you&rsquo;re set.</p>

<h1>All In With Docker</h1>

<p>If you want to run 100% in docker keep reading. Otherwise, thanks for coming or you can skip over this section to my thoughts on the CHE project.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2/1/16:</strong> Modifying the VirtualBox network settings as described below is not necessary. If you read the output from the <code>che.sh run</code> command you should see something like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>############## HOW TO CONNECT YOUR CHE CLIENT ###############
After Che server has booted, you can connect your clients by:
1. Open browser to http://192.168.99.101:8080, or:
2. Open native chromium app.
#############################################################
</code></pre>
<p>Just enter the address from #1 into your browser instead of localhost (below) and you should be fine. If you however you want to play with using <code>localhost</code> instead of the IP address the VirtualBox network settings I describe below should work for you. Otherwise, skip head to the part about starting up CHE.</p>

<h2>Using localhost</h2>

<p>If you want to be able to point your browser to localhost on OSX/Windows in VirtualBox forward port 8080 from your Docker VM to port 8080 on your host.</p>

<p><strong>Open Settings</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dvm-public-assets/images/2016/01_28/VirtualBox-Main.png" alt="VirtualBox Main" /></p>

<p><strong>Select &ldquo;Network&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dvm-public-assets/images/2016/01_28/VirtualBox-NetworkSettings.png" alt="Network Settings" /></p>

<p><strong>Add an entry to forward TCP port 8080 to 8080</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dvm-public-assets/images/2016/01_28/VirtualBox-PortForwarding.png" alt="Port Forwarding" /></p>

<p>Now the startup script will be able to communicate with Docker and your Eclipse CE Server.</p>

<p>If you forget this step you&rsquo;ll likely run into the following error when you try and start CHE:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>!!! Running &lsquo;docker&rsquo; succeeded, but &#39;docker ps&rsquo; failed. This usually means that docker cannot reach its daemon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Starting CHE</h1>

<p>From the command-line, navigate to the directory where you extracted the CHE archive:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ cd [directory path]
</code></pre>
<p>Now to start CHE:</p>

<p><strong>OSX / Linux</strong></p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ bin/che.sh -i run
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ bin\che.bat -i run
</code></pre>
<p>Once you see the following (with different timing of course) you&rsquo;re ready to go:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>- Server startup in 9605 ms
</code></pre>
<p>If you followed the VirtualBox directions above navigate to http://localhost:8080 and you should see your CHE Dashboard:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dvm-public-assets/images/2016/01_28/CHE-Dashboard.png" alt="CHE Dashboard" /></p>

<p>Otherwise, use the IP of your VirtualBox VM: </p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>http://[your_vm_ip]:8080. 
</code></pre>
<p>Click on &ldquo;New Project&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll see this:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dvm-public-assets/images/2016/01_28/CHE-NewProject.png" alt="CHE New Project" /></p>

<p>Out of the box you&rsquo;ll have &ldquo;Stacks&rdquo; for Java, Node, PHP, and ASP.NET (Mono).</p>

<p>At this point that&rsquo;s as far as I&rsquo;ve gone so for now I&rsquo;ll leave the experimentation as an exercise for the reader. I&rsquo;ll post again once I&rsquo;ve had more time to play with this.</p>

<p>For those interested in why they should care there are a couple things that give me reason to be really excited about CHE:</p>

<h1>Zero Impact Setup</h1>

<p>According the the home page one of the stated goals is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are building a world where anyone can contribute to a project without installing software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have long been a proponent of developer productivity. When on-boarding a new team member I strive to make the experience as close to checkout-build-run as possible. I believe the developer should be able setup their dev environment according to their own preferences and not have to spend days or week(s) setting up the project. </p>

<p>Also working on multiple branches should be just as painless. </p>

<p>At work we are looking to adopt Docker for our new environments and on my list of research is using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/" rel="nofollow">Docker Compose</a> to set up a full development environment. CHE would support not only the same goal but go even farther by not requiring the setup of a development environment - we could truly work from anywhere.</p>

<h1>Microsoft Support</h1>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/che/features/" rel="nofollow">CHE Features</a> page Microsoft is contributing to the CHE project. I haven&rsquo;t dug into the documentation yet (that&rsquo;s next) but given the work Microsoft have already done<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/OmniSharpMakingCrossplatformNETARealityAndAPleasure.aspx" rel="nofollow"> supporting intellisense in OmniSharp</a> and Visual Studio Code I think we&rsquo;ll see support for C# and ASP.NET on par with the Java support already provided by CHE. There&rsquo;s already an ASP.NET stack that comes with CHE, just not intellisense yet.</p>

<p>In and of itself this is really not that big a deal. However, Microsoft is getting ready to release <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/about_overview" rel="nofollow">Windows Server 2016 with native Docker support</a>, so I believe Microsoft will make sure that CHE works with Windows Containers as well. Since there are so many companies with heavy Microsoft investments and very complex setups I could see many (probably not all) could greatly benefit from what CHE is offering. </p>

<p>Of course I&rsquo;m making a few assumptions here: </p>

<ul>
<li>Windows Containers will support the full .NET Framework, not just the newly minted .NET Core and ASP.NET Core. I&rsquo;m pretty sure this is true.</li>
<li>Windows Containers will support full Windows Server installs, not just Windows Nano. I&rsquo;m not sure about this one.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on which of those assumptions are true will determine which projects could actually take advantage of such a scenario.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see this project as it progresses and if it meets my needs I hope to be able to contribute in some way.</p>

<h1>Updates</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>1/29/16:</strong> Updates based on recommendations by <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerJewell" rel="nofollow">@TylerJewell</a> and some errata.</li>
<li><strong>2/1/16:</strong> Updates clarifying that there is no need to change VirtualBox network settings</li>
</ul>
