    <summary type="html">Today Ayende released his sequential guid answer, which is something I had been working on as well. I’ll be honest and say the current implementation takes from his recent posts (previous to today’s). If it weren’t for him, I would not have known about</summary>

    <summary type="html">My last post addressed generating Guid values which were sequential across system boundaries. The problem with other algorithms is two-fold. First, they are only sequential for a single system. Second, they are based off the MAC address of the system</summary>
